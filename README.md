# Subnetting-with-ACL
Network Configuration with Cisco Packet Tracer
Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and management of a network using Cisco Packet Tracer. Key configurations include subnetting, DHCP implementation, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control communication between subnets.

## Achievements
 - Subnetting: Divided the network into multiple subnets for organized and efficient IP management.
 - DHCP Implementation: Ensured dynamic IP address assignment for devices, simplifying network administration.
 - ACLs: Implemented Access Control Lists to isolate and control traffic between subnets, enhancing network security.
 - Network Simulation: Visualized and tested the network configurations in Cisco Packet Tracer, validating the setup and functionality.
